# Lesgo-TREES
This is a LES code for simulating the complex flow in atmospheric boundary layer with the interaction of buildings, wind turbines and trees.
The original code is LESGO @ https://lesgo.me.jhu.edu/. I implemented the codes about introducing the drag effects of tree canopy.
The detailed settings for all 8 cases are referred to folder: flow+cube+windturbine+tree
